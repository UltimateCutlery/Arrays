# Task
We have a shopping list, however all the fruit and vegetables needs to be from one place - the farmers market.
So we need to take all the fruit and vegetables (as defined in the shopping list provided in the `ArraysShoppingTask.js` file) from the shopping list and put them into a new fruit and vegetables list.

The code will be checked by the following criteria: 
- The given lists are unchanged (`shoppingList` & `fruitVegList`)
- If a fruit or vegetable appears in the shopping list, it will appear in the fruit and vegetable list `fruitVegShoppingList`
